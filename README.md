# PDF Chatbot

This is a FastAPI application. It uses the `uvicorn` server to run the application.

## API endpoints
1. /upload : This endpoint accepts a file and stores it in the local file system.
2. /ask : This is websocket end point which recieves text (pdf_name||question) and sends answer. In between it also sends `loading` and `done` response to make sure the loader appear while the response is getting generated.

## Rate Limit
1. User/Client can open the websocket connection only twice in an hour.
2. User/Client can only send five messages for a pdf.

## Data storing
There are two models. One is `questions` which store all the questions and their answers for a particular pdf and the other one is `pdfMetadata` which stores the metadata of all the pdfs ever uploaded.
